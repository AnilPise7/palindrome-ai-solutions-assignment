    "# AI Solutions Engineer Interview Assignment – Palindrome Data\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook implements an end‑to‑end analysis of synthetic WhatsApp‑style conversations between an AI health chatbot and clients. The goals are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Ingest and parse** the conversation dataset.\n",
    "2. **Generate risk scores** for:\n",
    "   - HIV acquisition risk\n",
    "   - Mental health disorder risk\n",
    "3. **Produce a structured recommendation and care plan** aligned with high‑level principles from South African National Department of Health (NDOH) guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important note**  \n",
    "> This notebook is for a technical interview task only. All risk scores and care plans here are simple rule‑based prototypes, **not clinical tools** and **not medical advice**. Any real‑world deployment would need expert clinical review, validation, and strict safety governance."
